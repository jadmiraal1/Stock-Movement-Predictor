# Stock Movement Predictor

This project aims to build a stock movement prediction system that leverages both historical price data and real-time sentiment analysis from financial news and social media.
By combining transformer-based models (e.g., BERT/FinBERT) for natural language understanding with time-series modeling of stock prices, we create a hybrid machine learning
pipeline that predicts whether a given stock will go up or down over a short-term horizon (1â€“5 days).

The goal is to develop a model that is:
-More informative than price data alone, by including market sentiment signals
-Fully backtestable, with clear performance metrics
-Deployable for paper or live trading, using APIs like Alpaca
